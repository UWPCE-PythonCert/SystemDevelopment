Installing WXPython Demo
========================

We are going to download the source for the whole project from the github page, and then extract the demo part.

https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix

You can use git copy to download the repository:

git clone https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix.git

Once it is downlaoded, cd into the Phoenix directory. One of the subdirectories is called demo. Move this entire directory to somewhere useful. Here is the command I used:

::

   mv demo ~/python_examples/wxpython_demo

This moves the directory into a better place and gives it a better name. Now you can delete the rest of the Phoenix directory, as you don't need it.
