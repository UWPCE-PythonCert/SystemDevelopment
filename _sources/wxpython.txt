Desktop GUI development: wxPython
#################################

Introduction
============


Desktop GUIs:
-------------


Traditional Graphical User Interface Applications


Run entirely on local machine -- interactive, interface and logic code in one process



Advantages:

* Easier to write -- all in one program
* Faster -- data/interface direct communication
* Faster display: direct to screen (or even OpenGL, etc.)
* Runs without network
* Save/Manipulate local files
* Familiar install/start/stop/run, etc.


Python Options
--------------

Multiple GUI frameworks available:

* PyGTK
* PyQT / PySide
* TkInter
* wxPython
* PyGame
* Native GUIs: Cocoa (PyObjC), PythonWin
* Kivy for touchscreen (mobile) platforms
* Some more minor ones...


wxPython
=========

wxPython
---------

Why wxPython?

* Python wrapper around C++ toolkit (wxWidget)
* wxWidgets is a wrapper around **native** toolkit:

 * Windows: Win32 (64)
 * OS-X: Cocoa
 * Linux: GTK

* Native look and feel
* License: (modified) LGPL


Legacy: it was the best option for me when I first needed something...

See http://www.wxpython.org for more information


Installing
----------

wxPython is a big complicated build:

  - can't do ``pip`` or ``easy_install``

Windows or OS-X:

  - use the binaries on http://wxpython.org/download.php


Linux: use your system's package

NOTE: there are some issues with some packages:

* May be old version

* May use standard wx build -- more crash prone!

(some run-time checking turned off)


Versions
--------

"Stable" version: 2.8.12.1

("stable" means stable API, not less likely to crash)


"Development" version: 2.9.4.0

(Under active development, API may change (but not much)


wx project very slow to do official releases -- You probably want to use the development version: it's getting more attention


"Phoenix": next generation version: new bindings, Py3 support, etc.

-- Still experimental

Pythonic code:
--------------

Over the years, wxPython has grown a number of things to make it more "pythonic" -- hide some of that C++ legacy


Properties:

The C++ classes are full of getters and setters:

.. code-block:: python

  wxTextCtrl::SetValue
  wxTextCtrl::GetValue

These methods have been translated into properties for Python

.. code-block:: python

  MyTextCtrl.Value = some_string
  another_string = wxTextCtrl.Value


(The "Get/Set" versions are still there, but it's klunkier code)


.. nextslide::

Other Python options: some specific wx types can be accessed with standard python types:

``wxPoint`` --- ``(x,y)`` ( tuple )


``wxList`` --- ``[1,2,3]`` (python list)


``wxSize`` --- ``(w,h)`` (tuple)

...

Using these makes your code cleaner and more pythonic

Basic Structure
===============

How is a wxPython app structured?


Event-Driven programming
-------------------------

On app startup, the ``.MainLoop()`` method is called.


The mainloop takes control -- monitoring for events, then dispatching them.


Events can come from the system, or user interaction: keyboard, mouse, etc.


All the work of your app is done in response to events


You only need to response to (Bind) the events you care about


Not so different than a web app, except events are finer-grained
(every mouse move, etc.)


wx.Window
---------

Pretty much everything you see on the screen is a ``wx.Window``


It is the superclass for all the "widgets", "controls", or whatever you want to call them


It is essentially a rectangle on the screen that catches events


You generally don't use it by itself, though you may derive from it to make a new widget


**Historical Note:** "wxWidgets" was called "wxWindows" -- until Microsoft threatened to sue them.


.. nextslide::

Since everything is a ``wx.Window``, it's good to know its methods and signature:

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(parent,
                 id=wx.ID_ANY,
                 pos=wx.DefaultPosition,
                 size=wx.DefaultSize,
                 style=0,
                 name=wx.PanelNameStr)
    parent (wx.Window)
    id (int)
    pos (wx.Point)
    size (wx.Size)
    style (long)
    name (string)

http://xoomer.virgilio.it/infinity77/wxPython/Widgets/wx.Window.html

.. nextslide::

Methods types:

* Appearance: Colors, Fonts, Labels, Styles
* Geometry: Size, Position, IsShown, Move, etc.
* Layout: Sizers, etc.
* Many others!

Event-Driven programming
------------------------

On app startup, the .MainLoop() method is called.

The mainloop takes control -- monitoring for events, then dispatching them.

Events can come from the system, or user interaction: keyboard, mouse, etc.

All the work of your app is done in response to events

You only need to response to (Bind) the events you care about

Not so different than a web app, except events are finer-grained

(every mouse move, etc.)


wx.App
-------

Every wx app has a single wx.App instance:

.. code-block:: python

  app = wx.App(False)
  frame = DemoFrame(None, title="Micro App")
  frame.Show()
  app.MainLoop()


(the ``False`` means: "don't re-direct stdout to a Window")

And you almost always start the ``MainLoop``

wx.Frame
--------

``wx.Frame`` is a "top level" Window: One with a title bar, min-max buttons,etc.

Most apps have a single ``wx.Frame`` -- central interaction with the app.

This is where menu bars, etc are placed, and often the core GUI logic of the app.


.. code-block:: python

  class TestFrame(wx.Frame):
      def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
          kwargs.setdefault('title', "Simple test App")
          wx.Frame.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)


demo: ``code\basic_app_1.py``


controls
========

Menus
-----

A ``wx.Frame`` has a menu bar you can add items to:

.. code-block:: python

    # create the menu bar object
    menuBar = wx.MenuBar()

    # add a menu to it
    fileMenu = wx.Menu()

    # add an item to the menu
    openMenuItem = fileMenu.Append(wx.ID_ANY, "&Open", "Open a file" )
    #bind a handler to the menu event
    self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.onOpen, openMenuItem)

    self.SetMenuBar(menuBar)


demo: ``code\basic_app_2.py``


Event Handlers
--------------

Event handlers have a common signature:

.. code-block:: python

    def onOpen(self, evt=None):
        print "open menu selected"
        self.app_logic.file_open()


The second parameter is the ``wx.Event`` object that initiated the call -- it holds information about the event that can be useful}


I like to give the event parameter a default None, so the handler can be called from other parts of the code as well.


demo: ``code\basic_app_2.py``


Common Dialogs
--------------

wxPython provides a number of common Dialogs. These wrap the native ones where possible for a native look and feel.


* ``wx.MessageDialog``
* ``wx.ColourDialog``
* ``wx.FileDialog``
* ``wx.PageSetupDialog``
* ``wx.FontDialog``
* ``wx.DirDialog``
* ``wx.SingleChoiceDialog``
* ``wx.TextEntryDialog``
* ...



These do pretty much what you'd expect...


wx.FileDialog
-------------

Example use of a common dialog: ``wx.FileDialog``

.. code-block:: python

    dlg = wx.FileDialog(self,
                        message="Save file as ...",
                        defaultDir=os.getcwd(),
                        defaultFile="",
                        wildcard=wildcard,
                        style=wx.SAVE )
    if dlg.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:
        path = dlg.GetPath()
    else:
        print "The file dialog was canceled before anything was selected"
    dlg.Destroy()



example: ``code/basic_app_3.py``


Basic Widgets
-------------

All the basic widgets (controls) you'd expect are there:


* Buttons
* TextCtrl (Text Control)
* Check Boxes
* List Box
* Combo Box
* Slider
* Spin Control
* . . . . .


Way too many to list here!


See the docs and the Demo to find the one you need



Using a Control
---------------

A Button is about as simple as it gets


``__init__(parent, id, label="", pos=wx.DefaultPosition, ...)``


Mostly the same as wx.Window, and other controls....}

.. code-block:: python

  ## add just a single button:
  self.theButton = wx.Button(self, label="Push Me")
  self.theButton.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.onButton)

  ## and give it an event handler
  def onButton(self, evt=None):
      print "You pushed the button!"



code: ``code\basic_app_4.py``


wx.Panel
--------

A ``wx.Panel`` is a ``wx.Window`` that you can put other controls on

It supplies nifty things like tab traversal, etc.


You \emph{can} put controls right on a ``wx.Frame`` (we just did it), but a wx.Panel provided extra features, the "normal" look, and helps you organize and re-use your code


Mostly the same as wx.Window, and other controls...


.. nextslide::

.. code-block:: python

  class ButtonPanel(wx.Panel):
      def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
          wx.Panel.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

          self.theButton = wx.Button(self, label="Push Me")
          self.theButton.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.onButton)
      def onButton(self, evt=None):
          print "You pushed the button!"

And use it in the Frame:

.. code-block:: python

        self.buttonPanel = ButtonPanel(self)



code: ``code\basic_app_5.py``


Control Layout
--------------

With more than one control, you need to figure out how to place them
and how big to make them

You may have noticed that ``wx.Window`` takes ``pos`` and ``size`` parameters

You may have also noticed that I didn't use them.

Why not?



Absolute Positioning
--------------------

Specifying the size and location of controls with pixel coordinates.


This is a serious pain to do!


Though it can be made a lot easier with GUI-building tools...


So why not?


.. nextslide::

When you add or remove a control, the layout changes:

 - recalculate all positions and sizes


When you change the text on a control the layout changes:

 - recalculate all positions and sizes


When you try it on another platform the layout changes:

 - recalculate all positions and sizes}


When the user changes default font size, the layout changes:

 - recalculate all positions and sizes}



Sizers:
-------

The alternative is "Sizers"


``wx.Sizer`` is wx's system for automatically determining the size and location of controls


Instead of thinking in terms of what size and position a given control should be, you think in terms of how they relate to each other:


"I want a column of buttons all the same size along the left edge of the Panel"


Sizers capture that logic and compute the sizes for you


They will re-size things for you when anything changes -- adding, removing, changing labels, re-sizing the Window, etc...


.. nextslide::


Sizers take a while to wrap your brain around...


But it's worth the learning curve.


Nice discussion here:

http://wiki.wxpython.org/UsingSizers


I have the graphic posted on the wall by my desk...



Sizer Example
-------------

The Basic ``BoxSizer``:

- Lays out a row or column of controls...


..code-block:: python

    Sizer.Add( window, proportion, flag, border )
        ## do the layout
        S = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)

        S.Add(theButton1, 0, wx.GROW | wx.ALL, 4)
        S.Add(theButton2, 0, wx.GROW | wx.ALL, 4)

        self.SetSizerAndFit(S)


code: ``code\basic_app_6.py``


Nested Sizers
-------------

How do I get them centered both ways?

 - Nest a vertical sizer inside a horizonal one

 - And add stretchable spacers...


.. code-block:: python

  buttonSizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)

  buttonSizer.Add(theButton1, 0, wx.GROW | wx.ALL, 4)
  buttonSizer.Add(theButton2, 0, wx.GROW | wx.ALL, 4)

  mainSizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.HORIZONTAL)
  mainSizer.Add((1,1), 1)    # stretchable space
  mainSizer.Add(buttonSizer, 0, wx.ALIGN_CENTER) # the sizer with the buttons in it
  mainSizer.Add((1,1), 1)    # stretchable space


Widget Inspection Tool
----------------------

How do I keep all this straight?

The Widget Inspection Tool (WIT) is very handy:

.. code-block:: python

    app = TestApp(False)
    ## set up the WIT -- to help debug sizers
    import wx.lib.inspection
    wx.lib.inspection.InspectionTool().Show()
    app.MainLoop()


(you can also bring it up from a menu event, or...)


code: ``code\basic_app_7.py``



Other Sizers
------------

Sizers for laying out stuff in grids...

``wx.GridSizer``

``wx.FlexGridSizer``

``wx.GridBagSizer``

(you can do it all with a GridBagSizer)

See the docs for info.


Hierarchies...
--------------

wxPython has multiple independent hierarchies ...


The nested parent-child relationship:

* every ``wx.Window`` has a parent
* every ``wx.Window`` has zero or more children


The class Hierarchy

* sub classes of ``wx.Window``
* classes with instances as attributes


The Layout Hierarchy

* Sizers within Sizers...
* Arbitrarily deep.



Each of these takes care of different concerns: confusing but powerful


Accessing inputs
----------------

Much of the point of a GUI is to collect data from the user.


So you need to be able to access what s/he has input

..code-block:: python

  ## add a text control:
  self.textControl = wx.TextCtrl(self)

  def onGetData(self, evt=None):
      print "get data button pressed"
      contents = self.textControl.Value
      print "the contents are:", contents


Most controls have a ``.Value`` property


Setting Values
--------------

You also want to display data...

So you need to be able to set the values, too:

.. code-block:: python

  # and another text control:
  self.outTextControl = wx.TextCtrl(self,
                                    style=wx.TE_READONLY)

  def onGetData(self, evt=None):
      self.outTextControl.Value = self.inTextControl.Value


You can set the ``.Value`` property too...


example: ``code\basic_app8.py``


Code-generated GUIs...
----------------------

You shouldn't write the same repetitive code for a GUI...


You may need to build a GUI to match data at run time.


Lots of ways to do that with wxPython -- Sizers help a lot.


Try to do it whenever you find yourself writing repetitive code...


The key is how to do the event Binding:

..code-block:: python

    def OnButton(self, evt):
        label = evt.GetEventObject().GetLabel()

        do_somethign_with_label(label)


example: ``code/CalculatorDemo.py``


.. nextslide::

The "lambda trick"


-- a way to pass custom data to an event handler:

.. code-block:: python

  for name in ["first", "second", "third"]:
      btn = wx.Button(self, label=name)
      btn.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON,
               lambda evt, n=name: self.OnButton(evt, n) )
  ....

  def OnButton(self, Event, name):
      print "In OnButton:", name


http://wiki.wxpython.org/Passing%20Arguments%20to%20Callbacks


Miscellaneous
=============

Long Running Tasks
------------------

The UI is locked up while an event is being handled


So you want all event handlers to run fast.


But what if there is significant work to do?


Enter: threading and multi-processing


But: wxPython is not thread-safe: almost all wx methods must be called from within the same thread.


Thread-safe operations: Creating and Posting Events

``wx.CallAfter``
----------------

Easiest way to communicate with threads:

``wx.CallAfter``


Puts an event on the event stack, calls the designated function or method when the stack is cleared:

.. code-block:: python

  wx.CallAfter(function_to_call, *args, **kwargs)

  # *args, **kwargs are passed on to function_to_call


(see also: ``wx.CallLater()``)

BILS
----

Browser Interface, Local Server


Web app: Server runs on local machine


Browser is the interface -- but all running local


Can wrap the Browser window in a desktop app: Chrome Embedded Framework, wxWebkit, etc.


Good way to get both a web app and desktop app with one codebase


Example: Cameo Chemicals


(PyCon 2009: Browser Interface, Local Server Application)


LAB
---

Make a very simple address book app:

1. Really basic data model is in ``address_book_data.py``
2. Finish the form to edit an entry -- subclass of a ``wx.Panel`` (``entry_form.py``)
3. The form goes on a ``wx.Frame`` (``address_book_app.py``)
     add a way to switch between entries (``switcher.py``)
4. Add a "new record" button
5. Add file--save and file--open menus to the frame
6. Add some validation, better layout, etc....
