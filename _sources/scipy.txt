Scipy
=====

.. rst-class:: left

  The scipy "Stack" is a collection of core packages used for scientific / numerical computing.

  http://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html

  Many other domain-specific packages area available:

    Core "stack" is what most people will want, regardless of domain.

What's in the scipy stack?
--------------------------

* Python (http://www.python.org)
* NumPy (http://www.numpy.org)
* SciPy library (http://www.scipy.org)
* Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/)
* IPython (http://ipython.org/)

* nose (https://nose.readthedocs.org)
* pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* Sympy (http://sympy.org/)

Learning Resources
------------------

There are a lot of tutorials, documentation, etc. out there. IN this class, we only have a couple hours, so won't get that far. Here are some nice other options:

http://scipy-lectures.github.io/

https://github.com/SciTools/courses/blob/master/README.md

https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures

(note: this one does ``import *`` -- don't do that!)


numpy
-----

numpy is the core package that the rest of the scipy stack is built on.
numpy is really the core of everything.

All the rest requires an understanding good understanding of what a numpy array is -- so that's mostly what I'll talk about here.

Not just for lots of numbers!
(but it's great for that!)

http://www.numpy.org/


An N-Dimensional array object

A whole pile of tools for operations on/with that object.


Why numpy?
----------

Classic answer: Lots of numbers

  * Faster
  * Less memory
  * More data types

Even if you don't have lot of numbers:

  * N-d array slicing
  * Vector operations
  * Flexible data types


Why numpy?
----------

Wrapper for a block of memory:

  * Interfacing with C libs
  * PyOpenGL
  * GDAL
  * NetCDF4
  * Shapely

Image processing:

  * PIL
  * WxImage
  * ndimage


This Talk
----------

There are a lot of tutorials and documentation out there.

So I'm not going to spend much time on the regular old "how do you use it" stuff.

Rather, I'm going to cover a bit about the guts and some advanced issues.

This is harder to find explanations for -- and will help you understand what's really going on under the hood.



Array Constructors:
-------------------

From scratch:
 * ``ones(), zeros(), empty(), arange(), linspace(), logspace()``

 ( Default dtype: ``np.float64`` )

From sequences:
 * ``array(), asarray()`` ( Build from any sequence )

From binary data:
 * ``fromstring(), frombuffer(), fromfile()``

Assorted linear algebra standards:

``eye(), diag()``, etc.

demo: ``constructors.ipynb``



Slicing -- views:
-----------------

a slice is a "view" on the array -- new object, but shares memory:

::

    In [12]: a = np.array((1,2,3,4))
    In [13]: b = a[:]
    # for lists -- [:] means copy -- not for arrays!
    In [15]: a is b
    Out[15]: False
    # it's new array, but...
    In [16]: b[2] = 5
    In [17]: a
    Out[17]: array([1, 2, 5, 4])
    # a and b share data


demo: ``slice.ipynb``


Broadcasting:
-------------

Element-wise operations among two different rank arrays:

Simple case: scalar and array:
::

    In [37]: a
    Out[37]: array([1, 2, 3])
    In [38]: a*3
    Out[38]: array([3, 6, 9])


Great for functions of more than one variable on a grid

demo: ``broadcasting.ipynb``

What is an nd array?
--------------------

  * N-dimensional (up to 32!)
  * Homogeneous array:

    * Every element is the same type
          (but that type can be a pyObject)
    * Int, float, char -- more exotic types

  * "rank" â€“ number of dimensions
  * Strided data:

    * Describes how to index into block of memory
    * PEP 3118 -- Revising the buffer protocol


demo: ``mem_struct.ipynb``


Built-in Data Types
-------------------

  * Signed and unsigned Integers
        8, 16, 32, 64 bits
  * Floating Point
        32, 64, 96, 128 bits (not all platforms)
  * Complex
        64, 128, 192, 256 bits
  * String and unicode
        Static length
  * Bool --  8 bit
  * Python Object
        Really a pointer

demo: ``object.ipynb``


Text File I/O
--------------

Loading from text (CSV, etc):

  * ``np.loadtxt``
  * ``np.genfromtxt`` ( a few more features )

Saving as text (CSV):

  * ``np.savetxt()``

Compound dtypes
---------------


  * Can define any combination of other types
        Still Homogeneous:  Array of structs.
  * Can name the fields
  * Can be like a database table
  * Useful for reading binary data


demo: ``dtypes.ipynb``


Numpy Persistence:
------------------

``np.tofile() / np.fromfile()``

 -- Just the raw bytes, no metadata

pickle

``np.savez()``  -- numpy zip format

Compact: binary dump plus metadata

netcdf
  * NetCDF4

Hdf
  * Pyhdf
  * pytables


Working with compiled code
---------------------------

Wrapper around a C pointer to a block of data}

  * Some code can't be vectorized
  * Interface with existing libraries

Tools:

  * C API: you don't want to do that!
  * Cython: typed arrays
  * Ctypes
  * SWIG: numpy.i
  * Boost: boost array
  * f2py


Example of numpy+cython: http://wiki.cython.org/examples/mandelbrot

Other stuff:
------------

  * Masked arrays
  * Memory-mapped files
  * Set operations: unique, etc
  * Random numbers
  * Polynomials
  * FFT
  * Sorting and searching
  * Linear Algebra
  * Statistics

(And all of scipy, pandas, etc.)
