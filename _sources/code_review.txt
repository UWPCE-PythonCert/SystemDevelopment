Why code review
===============
As professional developers, we need to always be learning and improving. 

Code review is one of the best tools for this.

Code review is like having a personal tutor.


Getting code ready for review
-----------------------------

- First draft is messy
- Refactor
- Hope for no red marks, but expect they will be there
- To get the most out of it, correct all that you can first
- Code to review should be between 200 and 400 lines of code


what to look for
----------------

- readability
- 'pythonic'
- tests
- short functions/methods
- anything not clear


Types of code review
--------------------

- in person
- in-line comments
- using tools https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_code_review


When refactoring or doing code reviews in person 
------------------------------------------------
If code is unclear:
 
- write a comment explaining what the code is doing
- work on making the code clearer
- goal to make it clear enough to get rid of the comment(s)
