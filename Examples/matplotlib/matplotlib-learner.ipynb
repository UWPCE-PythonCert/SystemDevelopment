    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is the most popular and mature library for plotting data using Python. It has all of the functionality you would expect, including the ability to control the formatting of plots and figures at a very fine level.\n",

    "#### 1.1.1 Architecture\n",
    "Matplotlib is designed be be used in a wide variety of ways: for interactive plotting, generating images for publication or web sites, embedding in GUI programs, etc. It can generate PNG images, PDF, SVG, and native images for a number of GUI toolkits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, it has a varierty of \"back ends\" -- each for a different purpose, or for use with a different GUI toolkit. The system is designed to abstract the all the plotting commands and interaction, so that the code you wirte to gernerate plot is almost identical regradless of how you use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One use-case is embedding it for inline display in an iPython noteboo, such as this one. That is what this tutorial uses, but the plotting commands and principles are the same regardless of your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib has essentially two APIs: the core object oreiented API that mpl itself is written in, and a MATLAB-like \"state machine\" API (pylab). While the pylab API makes it a bit easier to quickly plot things up at the command line, it creates (or encourages, anyway) a very hard to maintain and re-use codeing style. And in most cases, the object oriented API requires only a few extra keystrokes, but keeps things much cleaner if (when) you want to move your plotting ocde to be a part of a larger application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutoroal woill use the OO API as much as possible, but many examples use the other API, so it can be helful to understand the realtionship between them."
