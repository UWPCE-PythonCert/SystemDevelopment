# Notes about Cython examples:

## Installing Cython:

$ pip install Cython

Cython files are named with the "pyx" extension (Pyrex legacy)

Note: Python syntax highlighting works pretty well in most editors.


## For simple functions:

def is callable from Python

cdef is only callable from Cython (or C)


## generating C code:

$ cython cy_add.pyx

generating "annotated" C code (HTML):

$ cython -a cy_add.pyx

Look at the html -- the yellow highlights are places where calls into the Python runtime are used.

## To build extension:

python cy_setup.py build_ext --inplace

(or develop or install....)

running nose or py.test should run all the tests. Or you can run each one on it's own.
